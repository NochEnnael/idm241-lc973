## Trigger

* a hover effect 

## Rules

* When the the mouse hovers over the featured article, the preview of the article changes its format. 
* FIRST STATE of the preview article. 
    * The article maintains a static position.
    * The photo is centered, the white text box with text is centered in the middle, and is slightly towards the bottom in order to show more of the image. 
    * There is a purple outline surround the image. The outline is not outside of the image box, but inside, giving it an inner border.
* SECOND STATE- when the image has a hover over it. 
    * The picture and the text box separate from one another, and are no aligned next to one another. 
    * The Picture moves to the right and sizes down while the text box moves to the left 
        * To give more attention to the article title and having people click onto the article to see what it is about, the image size is smaller than the text box size.
    * The Text box moves from the center of the image to expanding, and revealing more text as it moves to the left. 
        * Text revealed is created the article type, the small one sentece blurb, and the Read More button
        * Text Box is bigger: gives more attention to that than the Image, which was the inital attention grabber
    * Read More Button
        * This had its own micro-interaction as well
        * When you hover over the Read More, the Yellow box becomes smaller, and becomes an underline under the text to signify that it is an interactable/clickable link
    * Outline 
        * The outline that created a border inside of the Image now is outlining the Image and Text Box
        * There is some padding, so the outline isn't directly ontop of the Text Box and Image
    * Data Not seen by user
        * When the read more is clicked onto, there is data sent into the system to show that the article was clicked on 
        * can also go throguh data to make sure that the correct article is linked to that image/text box 
 * The whole micro-interaction feel 
    * I wanted to have a flowy, and gentle interaction, nothing that was too sharp that presented an anxious emotion 
    * The website promotes self-care, so I wanted to eminate that through the micro-interaction itself, showing the gradual change 

## Feedback 

* What the user sees is all of the different rules except for the backend 


## Loops/Modes
* These are only Modes, nothing is looping
* The Micro- Interactions only occur once the user puts their mouse over
    * One one thing happens, and nothing continually happens when the mouse is hovering over
