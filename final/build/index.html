                   The photo is centered, the white text box with text is centered in the middle, and is slightly towards the bottom in order to show more of the image. When hovered over, the Picture moves to the right and sizes down while the text box moves to the left. Then, the Text box moves from the center of the image to expanding, and revealing more text as it moves to the left.
