## Trigger
* Triggered with a hover state


## Rules and Feedback
* This had its own micro-interaction as well
* State One
    * The "Read More" button is completely yellow. The button is a square that surround the entire text with the text centered.
* State Two
    * When you hover over the Read More, the Yellow box becomes smaller, and becomes an underline under the text to signify that it is an interactable/clickable link. 
    * The yellow box that underlines is also off center from the text as well, shrinking to the bottom most corner of the rectangle.

## Feedback
*  The feeback is the same as the rules. The user sees the yellow background box at its full size, and then sees it get smaller, creating the outline

## Loops and Modes
* There are no Loops or Modes present.
